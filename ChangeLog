	Original perl module released, based on my (also CPAN contributed)
	script "make_rpm.pl".  Works well on RedHat 6.* and RedHat 7.* and
	is compatible with both rpm version 3.* and rpm version 4.*.

	Fixing a bug in Make.pm to allow customization of the RPM group
	(such as Utilities/System or Applications/Editors).
	Minor improvements throughout the module.  Documenting
	subroutines more clearly.  Supporting multiple smaller steps in 
	test.pl.  Support handling of different architectures other than
	i386.

	Fixing several bugs:  no more duplication of $group variable name;
	no more hardcoding of RPM release number; accommodating rpm
	version >4.0.2 command-line syntax; fixing pre example in
	POD synopsis.  The 'clean' target now cleans up rpms made during
	testing as well as TempBuildLoc.
